## How to install R and RStudio


> **Please make sure that your computer has both R and RStudio installed and working.**

Having the latest versions of both R and RStudio is advised, so if you have R and RStudio already installed, please upgrade to recent versions (3.5.0+ for R, and 1.1.4xx+ for RStudio).


### Download and install R

* Download R for windows from here: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

* Download R for Linux: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)


We will use RStudio for the course, that is an integrated development environment which will make sure that writing in R is a more pleasurable experience. More on how to use it during our first class.
